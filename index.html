      This document defines how a stream of media can be captured from a DOM
      element, such as a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>,
      or <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element, in the form of
      a <code>MediaStream</code> [[!GETUSERMEDIA]].

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      This document describes an extension to both HTML media elements and the
      HTML canvas element that enables the capture of the output of the element
      in the form of streaming media.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captured media is formed into a <code>MediaStream</code>
      [[GETUSERMEDIA]], which can then be consumed by the various APIs that
      process streams of media, such as WebRTC [[WEBRTC]], or Web Audio
      [[WEBAUDIO]].

  <section id="conformance">
    <p>
      This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
      product: the <dfn>user agent</dfn> that implements the interfaces that it
      contains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in this
      specification must implement them in a manner consistent with the
      ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]], as
      this specification uses that specification and terminology.

    <h2>HTML Media Element Media Capture Extensions</h2>

    <p>
      The <code><a>captureStream</a>()</code> and
      <code><a>captureStreamUntilEnded</a>()</code> methods are defined on HTML
      [[!HTML5]] media elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both <code>MediaStream</code> and <code>HTMLMediaElement</code> expose the
      concept of a <q>track</q>.  Since there is no common type used for
      <code>HTMLMediaElement</code>, this document uses the term
      <dfn>track</dfn> to refer to either <code><dfn><a
      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#videotrack">VideoTrack</a></dfn></code>
      or <code><dfn><a
      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#audiotrack">AudioTrack</a></dfn></code>.
      <code><dfn><a
      href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#idl-def-MediaStreamTrack">MediaStreamTrack</a></dfn></code>
      is used to identify the media in a <code><dfn><a
      href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#idl-def-MediaStream">MediaStream</a></dfn></code>.
    </p>

    <dl class="idl" title="partial interface HTMLMediaElement">
      <dt>MediaStream captureStream()</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The <code><dfn>captureStream</dfn>()</code> method produces a
          real-time capture of the media that is rendered to the media element.
        </p>
        <p>
          The captured <code>MediaStream</code> comprises of
          <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s that render the content from the set of
          <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#dom-videotracklist-selectedindex">selected</a>
          (for <code><a>VideoTrack</a></code>s,
          or other exclusively selected <a>track</a> types) or <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#dom-audiotrack-enabled">enabled</a>
          (for <code><a>AudioTrack</a></code>s,
          or other <a>track</a> types that support multiple selections)
          <a>track</a>s from the media element.  If the media element does not
          have a selected or enabled <a>track</a>s of a given type, then no
          <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> is present in the captured stream.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element can therefore capture a video
          <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> and any number of audio
          <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s. An <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element
          can capture any number of audio <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s.  In
          both cases, the set of captured <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s could
          be empty.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>captureStream</code> produces a <code>MediaStream</code> that
          captures any media that is currently playing on the element.  Changes
          in the media element source do not cause the stream to terminate,
          though the set of <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s might change over
          time.  If the source stream for the media element ends, or the a
          different source is selected, the <code>MediaStream</code> captures
          the state of the media element.  This means that there could be
          periods where the captured stream has no active media content.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the selected <a>VideoTrack</a> changes or enabled
          <a>AudioTrack</a>s change for the media element,
          <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s are added or removed as necessary to
          ensure that the <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s in the
          <code>MediaStream</code> correctly reflect the changes.  Necessary
          <code><a
          href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#event-mediastream-addtrack">addtrack</a></code>
          and <code><a
          href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#event-mediastream-removetrack">removetrack</a></code>
          events are generated to notify applications of these changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          A captured <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> ends when the <a>track</a>
          that it captures ends.  Captured <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s also
          end when <a>track</a>s that are rendered to the media element change,
          causing the <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> to be removed from the
          captured stream.  That is, when a different
          <code><a>VideoTrack</a></code> is selected or the corresponding
          <code><a>AudioTrack</a></code> is disabled.
        </p>
        <p>
          If media playback is paused, the captured stream continues to produce
          whatever is being actively rendered to the element.  What is rendered
          to the captured stream will vary based on the type of media; a
          <code><a>VideoTrack</a></code> might capture a still frame, or an
          <code><a>AudioTrack</a></code> might capture silence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether a media element is actively rendering content (e.g., to a
          screen or audio device) has no effect on the content of captured
          streams.  Muting the audio on a media element does not cause the
          capture to produce silence, nor does hiding the media element suppress
          captured video.
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt>MediaStream captureStreamUntilEnded()</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          A stream captured using <code>captureStreamUntilEnded()</code>
          captures the rendered output from a single media resource.  The
          resulting stream ends when the media element has <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#ended-playback">ended
          playback</a>, or when the media element is changed to render a
          different resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code><dfn>captureStreamUntilEnded</dfn>()</code> operates in the same
          way that <code><a>captureStream</a>()</code> does, except that when a
          captured <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> is removed from the
          <code>MediaStream</code> no further <a>track</a>s are added.
        </p>
        <p>
          A stream captured with <code>captureStreamUntilEnded()</code> MAY
          still start with fewer <a>track</a>s than the media element permits.
          The first <a>track</a> of any given type that becomes selected or
          enabled results in a <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> being added to the
          captured stream.  Only the first <a>track</a> of a given type is
          added; new <code><a>AudioTrack</a></code>s that are enabled are not
          added to the capture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once all <a>track</a>s in the captured stream have been removed, the
          captured stream becomes permanently inactive.  New <a>track</a>s are
          not added to the capture, even if they are the first of their type.
        </p>
        <p class="Note">
          This allows for a media element that renders multiple media types to
          be captured without a complete set of media being present when the
          capture is initiated.  For instance, a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>
          element might initially only render audio, but have a
          <code><a>VideoTrack</a></code> added (or selected) after the capture
          commences.  A late-starting <code><a>VideoTrack</a></code> would
          consequently be added to the capture.  However, if the
          <code><a>VideoTrack</a></code> commences after the
          <code><a>AudioTrack</a></code> ends, then the
          <code><a>VideoTrack</a></code> will not be added to the captured
          <code>MediaStream</code>.

    <h2>HTML Canvas Element Media Capture Extensions</h2>

    <p>
      The <code><a href="#canvas-captureStream">captureStream</a>()</code>
      method is added to the HTML [[!HTML5]] canvas element.  The resulting
      <code><a>CanvasCaptureMediaStream</a></code> provides methods that allow
      for controlling when frames are sampled from the canvas.
    </p>

    <dl class="idl" title="partial interface HTMLCanvasElement">
      <dt>CanvasCaptureMediaStream captureStream(optional double frameRate)</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The <code id="canvas-captureStream">captureStream()</code>
          method produces a real-time video capture of the surface of the
          canvas.  The resulting media stream has a single video <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> that
          matches the dimensions of the canvas element.
        </p>
        <p>
          This method throws a <xref
          target="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/infrastructure.html#securityerror">SecurityError</xref>
          exception if the canvas is not <dfn><a
          href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/scripting-1.html#concept-canvas-origin-clean">origin-clean</a></dfn>.
          The captured stream immediately ceases to capture content from the
          canvas if the <a>origin-clean</a> flag of the canvas becomes false at
          any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a>user agent</a> SHOULD <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/webappapis.html#await-a-stable-state">await
          a stable state</a> in the script execution of the current page or
          worker that has control of the canvas before capturing a frame.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to support manual control of frame capture, browsers MUST
          support a value of 0 for <code>frameRate</code>.  The captured stream
          always captures at least one frame, even if <code>frameRate</code> is
          zero.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the <code>frameRate</code> value is omitted, the <a>user agent</a>
          SHOULD capture new frames each time that the content of the canvas
          changes.
        </p>

      <h2>The <code>CanvasCaptureMediaStream</code></h2>

      <p>
        The <code><dfn>CanvasCaptureMediaStream</dfn></code> is an extension of
        <code>MediaStream</code> that provide a single
        <code>requestFrame()</code> method.  Applications that depend on tight
        control over the rendering of content to the media stream can use this
        method to control when frames from the canvas are captured.
      </p>

      <dl class="idl" title="interface CanvasCaptureMediaStream : MediaStream">
        <dt>readonly attribute HTMLCanvasElement canvas</dt>
        <dd>
          The canvas element that this media stream captures.
        </dd>

        <dt>void requestFrame()</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            The <code><dfn>requestFrame</dfn>()</code> method allows
            applications to manually request that a frame from the canvas be
            captured and rendered into the media stream.  In cases where
            applications progressively render to a canvas, this allows
            applications to avoid capturing a partially rendered frame.

    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      Media elements can render media resources from origins that differ from
      the origin of the media element.  In those cases, the contents of the
      resulting <code>MediaStream</code> MUST be protected from access by the
      document origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      How this protection manifests will differ, depending on how the content is
      accessed.  For instance, rendering inaccessible video to a
      <code>canvas</code> element [[2DCONTEXT]] causes the <var><a
      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext2/#the-image-argument-is-not-origin-clean">origin-clean</a></var>
      property of the canvas to become <code>false</code>; attempting to create
      a Web Audio <code>MediaStreamAudioSourceNode</code> [[WEBAUDIO]] succeeds,
      but produces no information to the document origin (that is, only silence
      is transmitted into the audio context); attempting to transfer the media
      using WebRTC [[WEBRTC]] results in no information being transmitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The origin of the media that is rendered by a media element can change at
      any time.  This is even the case for a single media resource.  User agents
      MUST ensure that a change in the origin of media doesn't result in
      exposure of cross origin content.
